# Lets-Split-keymap

This keymap is supposed to use primarily English but also Italian (especially the accented vowels) through the tap dance function.
For example: 1 tap for E, 2 taps for è, 3 taps for é, and so for all the 5 vowels.

I included the process_unicode.h to avoid errors during the makefile function.

No long-string Macros for now.

Deleted the Dvorak and the original Raise layer from keymap.
